Advent of Code 2017 - Rust implementation of my solutions

This repository is just a collection of the solutions that I created
for the 2017 edition of the Advent of Code competition.
The problems themselves can be found [here](http://adventofcode.com/2017).
I strongly encourage you to give it a try and support its creator!

## How to run
This project was built in Rust 1.22.1,
and requires cargo to be compiled.
Please refer to [Rust's official website](https://www.rust-lang.org/)
for instructions to install the necessary tools.

To run the program, just execute `cargo run [day] [part] [filename]`
to solve the problem of the corresponding day and part,
and taking the filename as input.
You can also omit the filename parameter to run the solver
on my own input files.

For example, `cargo run 7 2` will solve the 2nd part
of the day 7 problem with my personal input,
located in `input/day7` .
